Files--------
scraper.py
    compiles data sets for use in training

classifier.py
    trains models in order to be used in perceptron classifier

Instructions to run----------

running 'python scraper.py' will scrape the associated data files, and write them to memory for quick reading between runs

running 'python classifier.py [nEpoch] [ignoredIndices]' will run the classifier and plot model accuracy
    @required nEpoch is the number of epochs to run before termination
    @optional ignoredIndices is the indices to ignore seperated by spaces

Example: python classifier.py 30 0 1 2

Will train for 30 epochs, ignoring dayOfTheWeek (as the one-hots take up three indices)

Example: python classifier.py 20 16

Will train for 20 epochs, ignoring snacks
